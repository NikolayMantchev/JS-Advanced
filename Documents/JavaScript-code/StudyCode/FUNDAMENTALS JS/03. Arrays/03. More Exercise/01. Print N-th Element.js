/*Write a function that collect each element of an array, on a given step.
The input comes as array of strings. The last element is N - the step.
The collections are every element on the N-th step starting from the first one. 
If the step is "3", you need to print the 1-st, the 4-th, the 7-th â€¦ and so on, 
until you reach the end of the array. Then, print elements in a row, separated by 
single space.
